# Veterati Log In - Quick Script

## What is Veterati?

Veterati is a mentorship site used by military veterans to create networking opportunities in various fields of work. In kickstarting my career, I was scheduling and taking phone calls through the platform **every single day**.

## What problem is being solved?

I noticed the inefficiency of logging into the website through a number of unnecessary clicks. I thought there must be a way to do this quicker and rid myself of the annoyance, which pushed me to pursue this quick project.

## How did I solve this problem?

Upon doing further research, it became clear to me to use a package called __Selenium__. This package is used primarily as a web-based tool for automation, which seemed perfect for the task at hand. 

This meant going through the documentation, and understanding the different ways to extract the fields needed to be "clicked" and "send_keys" to. This also meant the installation of the __chromedriver__, which is an open source tool for automation that allows for the browser to execute these Selenium functions.
